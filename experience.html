            contracting, invoicing, debtor management etc. Since 2012 I had to manage a growth of 30-40% every year in
            traffic (and revenue). What started as a single server application became a full 'cluster' including load
            balancing, application servers, background servers, fully replicated database servers (<mark>PostgreSQL,
              Redis</mark>) and monitoring.

          <p>In the last year, the decision was made to migrate to a <mark>Phoenix/Elm</mark> stack. The first step was
            to create a hybrid application by session sharing with a Phoenix backend. The Phoenix backend was
            responsible for handling the more intensive background jobs in order to reduce the load on the Rails
            backend.</p>
