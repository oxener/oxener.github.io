        Frank Oxener is an experienced software developer working with <mark>Ruby and Rails</mark> since 2006 as a
        (remote) freelancer. In 2015 he discovered the beauty and elegance of functional languages, if possible he would
        use (and even advise to use) <mark>Elixir</mark> and/or <mark>Elm</mark> in his assignments.
      </div>
      <div class="row lead">
        Besides his technical skills, Frank would say that his main asset is the translation (and implementation) of the
        often not so clear requirements from clients in working features and/or applications in the most iterative way
        as possible. He believes that this quality was one of the major success factors in transforming a bootstrapped
        Internet company into a solid and successful business in the childcare sector.
      </div>
      <div class="row lead">
        Frank has a keen ability to communicate and explain very technical problems into clear understandable
        essentials, which was also very useful in coaching junior developers.
      </div>
      <div class="row lead">
        Before starting as an IT freelancer Frank had a long career in the Chemical industry as a process-operator,
        trainer, research engineer and as IT-consultant. During this part of his career he started Studio Didacto, an
        innovation center within the Atos Origin organization. He also was a facilitator in change projects where he
        used the socratic method and appreciative inquiry. In 2006 he was one of the founders of the Dutch
        <mark>Fablab</mark> Foundation (<a href="http://fablab.nl" target="_blank">Fablab.nl</a>).
      </div>
      <div class="row lead">
        Frank lives in Alkmaar, is married and has three children. In his spare time, he likes to tinker with
        electronics, CNC machines and 3D printers. He also loves to mountain bike and to (inline) skate.
